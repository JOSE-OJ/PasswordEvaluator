This tool only evaluates password strength based on predefined rules. It does not protect against real-world hacking
techniques like phishing, brute-force attacks, or data breaches.Even if a password is rated "strong", it does not 
guarantee absolute security. Users should follow best practices such as using unique passwords per site and enabling
multi-factor authentication.This tool should be used to educate individuals on improving password security, not to 
falsely assure them that a password is unbreakable.
